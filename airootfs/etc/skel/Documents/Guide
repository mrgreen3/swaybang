The installer is menu driven and very easy to follow.

===Pacman===

To get pacman running live you will need a working network connection, either wired [connects automatically] or wireless via network icon on panel [click on it!].

Live you do not need to do the following commands but post install you will need to set up pacman keys open a terminal and run:

sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate
sudo pacman -Syyu archlinux-keyring

This will create keys, refresh package cache and install archlinux-keyring.

Then you can search for a package of choice using:

sudo pacman -Ss

Install a pacakge using

sudo pacman -S
